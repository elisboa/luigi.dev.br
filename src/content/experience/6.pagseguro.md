I work as an System Reability Engineer on a platform team in a hybrid cloud environment, managing both AWS and company private cloud resources. My primary responsibilities include supporting and engineering highly available servers in production.

In my role, I work closely with developers to deliver high-quality products and services. I manage these critical systems: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Sensedia API Gateway, which are essential components of our team's platform services.
